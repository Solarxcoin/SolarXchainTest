Solarx blockchain is currently undergoing thorough testing to ensure its reliability and stability.
This crucial phase allows us to identify and address any potential issues, ensuring that we deliver a robust and secure blockchain network.

It's important to note that while we are in the testing phase, this is not the final stage of our blockchain development.
After completing these tests, the blockchain will undergo further enhancements and optimizations to meet the highest standards of performance and security.
